# Working Group Leadership

How Working Group (WG) leadership is defined and roles within the WGs.  Anyone can be a part of a Working Group and participate in calls and code writing and review. See our [Working Group Management](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/main/technical/Working_Group_Management.md) document for more day-to-day details.

## Working Group Steering Committee

- Each WG is administered by a WG Steering Committee (“WGSC”).
- WGSC composed of any number of members.
- WGSC members serve a one year term.
- The WGSC members can be an employee or representative of a Member of the Foundation, must be nominated by the member who employs or engages them, and serve subject to the consent of that member.
- WGSC shall elect one or two chairs from among its members, who serve at the pleasure of the WGSC members. One chair can be required by the WGSC to be a city representative.
- WGSC is responsible for assigning Maintainer and Reviewer roles to Contributors of the WG, and determining the status of Deliverables.
- Any vacancies may be filled by the board.

## WGSC Roles

- **Chair(s)** - Oversees the WG, agendas, facilitates calls, documents work, and leads the WG efforts.
- **Maintainer** - Have commit privileges in the main MDS repository and are responsible for implementing changes such as merging of pull requests and the creation of release branches.

### Meetings

These soft roles for meetings could be done by single or multiple people, WGSC members or OMF Staff, and can overlap with the WGSC roles above. 

- **Host** - Runs the meetings, keeps meetings on track, shares agenda and screen to show information. Follows [meeting guidance](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/main/technical/Conference_Call_Meeting_Guidance.md). Usually the Chair, but could be another member or OMF staff if no WGSC members are available.
- **Outreach** - Reach out a few days before meetings to specific groups or individuals that their attendance would be helpful. Leave comments with links to the WG meeting on the appropriate Issues and PRs.
- **Facilitator** - Opens meeting, greets people, kicks things off to the host, facilitates conversation, nudges people if appropriate, monitors the chat for comments and questions and shares with the group, thanks people for coming/participating.
- **Note Taker** - Take notes during meetings, shares notes with host, chair, and OMF Staff after the meeting, or puts the notes directly on the meeting page. Captures discussions, agreements, disagreements, action items, to do items, followups.
